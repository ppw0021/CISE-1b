Fronend port is 3000 
To execute the frontend, CD into the frontend directory and run this command:
    cd frontend
    npm start

Backend port is 6000 in the .env file.
To execute the backend, CD into the nest_backend directory and run this command:
    cd nest_backend
    npm start

To quickly deploy both frontend and backend code to the Raspberry pi on bachpad.ddns.net:3000.
This will automatically containerise both the frontend and backend together, 
    (cmd)
    bash deploy-to-pi.sh



To run this normally, cd to frontend and do 'npm run dev'
To run the backend, cd to backend and do 'npm run start'

This should connect to the db and load the front end application.
